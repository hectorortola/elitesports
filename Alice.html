<p></p>
<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having</p>
<p>nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had</p>
<p>no pictures or conversations in it,"and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice without</p>
<p>pictures or conversation?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel</p>
<p>very sleepy and stupid, whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the</p>
<p>trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran</p>
<p>close by her.</p>
<p></p>
</br><h1 id="chapter-2">CHAPTER II - The Pool of Tears</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she</p>
<p>quite forgot how to speak good English); now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p>
<p>ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out</p>
<p>of sight, they were getting so far off). "oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p>
<p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I shan't be able! I shall be a great</p>
<p>deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I</p>
<p>must be kind to them,' thought Alice, or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me</p>
<p>see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Alice stretched tall</p>
<p></p>
<p>And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. "They must go by the carrier,'</p>
<p>she thought; and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the</p>
<p>directions will look!</p>
<p></p>
<p>         ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</p>
<p>                  HEARTHRUG,</p>
<p>                           NEAR THE FENDER,</p>
<p>                                     (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine</p>
<p>feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled</p>
<p>feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p>
<p>uncomfortable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this,</p>
<p>and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly</p>
<p>with them, as if she had ...</p>
